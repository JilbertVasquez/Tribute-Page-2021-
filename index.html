        <p id = "background-of-Albert-Einstein">Albert Einstein was a German scientist and mathematician who pioneered the special and general theories of relativity. For his explanation of the photoelectric phenomenon, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. After being targeted by the German Nazi Party, he emigrated to the United States in the next decade.</p>

        <li><strong>1889</strong> - Albert was exposed to math and science by Max. Albert was ten years old at the time.</li>
        <li><strong>1894</strong> - Albert completed his education in Munich, where he received medical training. With his family, he relocated to Milan.</li>
        <li><strong>1895</strong> - At the age of 16, Albert traveled to Switzerland to attend Aarau Cantonal School.</li>
        <li><strong>1896</strong> - Albert receives the highest grade in his class.</li>
        <li><strong>1901</strong> - Even after performing so well, Albert eased off in his studies. He had a difficult time obtaining a solid job as a result of this.</li>
        <li><strong>1902</strong> - Albert Einstein managed to get a job as a patent examiner. In his new position, he put his math and scientific knowledge to good use.</li>
        <li><strong>1905</strong> - Einstein's first document on his thermodynamics theory was submitted.</li>
        <li><strong>1911</strong> - He was invited to the world's first-ever physics conference. He was the school's youngest physicist.</li>
        <li><strong>1913</strong> - He thought that science's knowledge of gravity was incorrect, so he devised a new hypothesis that he would later put to the test during a solar eclipse.</li>
        <li><strong>1919</strong> - Einstein's name became famous after he published his Theory of Relativity and accurately predicted the effects of a solar eclipse.</li>
        <li><strong>1922</strong> - Einstein received his first Nobel Peace Prize. He received the news while on his way to Japan.</li>
        <li><strong>1933</strong> - He came to America for the first time because he was afraid of Germany's burgeoning Nazi party.</li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - He made significant contributions to the fields of heat, gravity, and relativity, and he published over 300 scholarly papers.</li>
        <li><strong>1955</strong> - Albert Einstein died of heart failure in April.</li>
